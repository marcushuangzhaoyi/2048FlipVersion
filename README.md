# 2048FlipVersion
A school project I did before, creating 2048 games that you can flip the board for 90 or 180 degrees to play.
Please run the program in cmd, compile first then type in "java Gui2048" to play
一个可以对2048的面板进行翻转的2048 游戏。在普通的2048玩法上可以使用其他按键翻转面板。按H对板子进行水平翻转，按V对板子
进行垂直翻转，按A进行逆时针翻转，按R进行顺时针翻转
请在cmd窗口内部运行通过“java Gui2048”运行程序

# how to play it
Just like playing normal 2048 games, use up, down, left, right keys to move the blocks in the grid. However,
you can flip the board as well. Press H to flip the board horizontally, Press V to flip the board vertically
Press R to rotate the board clockwise, Press A to flip the board anticlockwise. You can also save the board
in the same directory by pressing S

To show the flipping better I use this picture to show the state of the game after playing for a while:
