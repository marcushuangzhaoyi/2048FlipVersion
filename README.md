# 2048FlipVersion
A school project I did before, creating 2048 games that you can flip the board for 90 or 180 degrees to play
Please run the code in cmd, compile first then java Gui2048

# how to play it
Just like playing normal 2048 games, use up, down, left, right keys to move the blocks in the grid. However,
you can flip the board as well. Press H to flip the board horizontally, Press V to flip the board vertically
Press R to rotate the board clockwise, Press A to flip the board anticlockwise. You can also save the board
in the same directory by pressing S

# example of doing the rotation/flip
